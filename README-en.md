This project has some java file examples to test the Java SDK for efi API.

## Requirements
* Java >= 7.0

## Running examples
Update the src/main/resources/credentials.json file with client_id, client_secret and certificate of your application.

You can run using any Java IDE, like Eclipse or Netbeans, with Maven plugin installed, and follow these steps:
1. clone this git repository in a local directory of your choice;
2. on your IDE, open the folder as a Maven project. It'll download sdk-java-apis-efi as a dependencie;
3. choose any project's example and run it as a Java Application. The result will be displayed on the console.

**Warning:** Some examples require you to change some parameters to work, like br.com.efi.charges.carnet.json.DetailCarnet.java where you must change the id parameter.
